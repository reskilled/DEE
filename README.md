# Developer Experience and Efficiency

Welcome at comprehensive repository dedicated to enhancing the productivity and work experience of developers. This repository is an essential resource for programmers seeking to streamline their workflow and maximize efficiency. Here, you'll find a curated collection of tools, best practices, tips, and strategies focused on boosting your coding efficiency and improving your overall experience as a developer.

DEE approach is based on work on three levels:

## Strategy
Strategy is the highest level of planning, encompassing long-term goals and directions. It focuses on understanding the needs of the organization, business objectives, and determining the optimal digitalization strategy.

## Tactics
Tactics involve medium-term planning and decisions on the implementation of strategies. This is where the methods, processes, and practices to be used to achieve strategic goals are determined.

## Operational Activities
Operational activities are the daily tasks and processes that directly contribute to the creation and delivery of software. This stage focuses on executing tactical plans and achieving short-term goals.

# General theses

1. One hour of strategic analysis and planning can save 100 hours of work.

2. Work efficiency can be increased by identifying and optimizing constraints.

3. Instead of focusing on optimizing individual stages, the entire software development process should be optimized in the context of the whole project team, and ideally, the entire organization.

4. Clarity and accuracy of goals set before developers are crucial in the process of optimizing productivity. Wrong analysis and goals can't be overcome by super fast AI (GPT, Copilot) at the operational level.

5. Constraints are inevitable - they must be continuously detected and eliminated.
   
6.  There is no perfect work setup - during the process, we will need to correct and adjust each process to the main business goals.
